# UNOGameProject

What is UNO?
UNO is a very fun and easy card game.
It can be played by 2 to 10 players. The goal is to be the first person to get rid of all your cards.
Each player starts with 7 cards.
A card can be played if it has the same color or number as the one on the table.
If a player cannot play, they must draw one card from the deck.
There are also special cards:
CARD	EFFECTS:
Skip - Next player misses their turn
Reverse - The play order changes direction
Draw Two - (+2)	Next player draws 2 cards and loses their turn.
Wild - The player playing it chooses the next color.
Wild Draw Four (+4) - Changes the color and next player takes 4 cards

When a player has only one card left, they must say “UNO!”
If they forget and someone notices before their next turn, they must take 2 more cards. The round ends when one player has no cards left. Points are counted from the cards that other players still have.
In our project, the game will have all the original rules and actions just like the real uno game.
